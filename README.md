# Link Status Preview Chrome Plugin

A simple chrome plugin to check if an external link on a page is accessible. Very naive approach to the problem. The JS sends a get request for each external link and evaluates the request status. I'm just playing around, don't judge.

### Installation

 - Fork, download as zip, copy this repository
 - Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome.
 - Make sure `Developer mode` is clicked on top right
 - Click on `Load unpacked extension..`
 - Navigate to source folder and open

## TODO
Alot...Need to improve the display of the request status, check its working for all edge cases, find edge cases. Do whatever you want with this repo. Use it as a boilerplate to write you own Chrome extensions if you want.
